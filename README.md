# stm32f407vgt6-

Hardware abstraction layer(HAL)

CAN protocol (ISO 11898-2).

An application build for this protocol uses two nodes but I only provided code for one node which is stm32f407.
The second node used in this application is stm32f429 which is also compatible with the same code, Just device driver files will change.

Low power Modes of arm processor and stm32 controller.

Basic and General purpose Timers, internal RTC.
